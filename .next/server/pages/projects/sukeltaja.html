The project was completed as part of a software development course at the University of Helsinki in 2019, which I took for a total of 10 academic credits over a period of 4 months. This course was part of Bachelor&#x27;s degree in Computer Science, which means that we didn&#x27;t have any prior experience with UX.<br/><br/>Our primary objective was to add new features from the backlog and simplify the user experience of the app, while still retaining the essential features that the client requested. To accomplish this, we utilized design tools Figma and Photoshop to design and prototype the user experience, and we implemented the frontend using React Native and Expo, and the backend with Node and the Express library.<br/><br/>Throughout the project, we worked closely with the client to ensure that their needs and preferences were being met. I am pleased to report that the client was very satisfied with the final result. From my personal view this work was the spark for me to get interested more with UX/UI design than software development.<br/><br/>However as this wasn&#x27;t a supposed to be UX course and the course was mostly about learning software development in agile teams than designing, we still managed to pinpoint problems and create solutions from our team&#x27;s perspective and with the help of the user feedback.</p></div><img src="/_next/static/media/mockup.f0f6ed19.png" width="1004" height="2000" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="w-10/12 h-full bg-center bg-cover col-span-1 flex-nowrap -mt-12 hidden xl:block" loading="lazy" style="color:transparent"/></div><img src="/_next/static/media/coverKuva.a552bf02.png" width="1400" height="607" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="w-full h-full bg-center bg-cover duration-500 mt-20 rounded-3xl" loading="lazy" style="color:transparent"/><h1 class="mt-20 text-1xl md:text-4xl text-white font-bold leading-tight text-left">Problem 1: Creating event</h1><h2 class="mt-5 text-1xl md:text-xl text-white leading-tight text-left my-20">Based on feedback from clients, we identified an opportunity to streamline the process of creating an event within our app. The previous process required users to navigate through multiple screens and complete multiple steps, including marking an event as &quot;active&quot; before being able to interact with it. <br/> <br/>To address this issue, we redesigned the event creation flow by reducing the number of steps and screen transitions required. We achieved this by integrating the event creation form directly within the map screen, allowing users to easily find the location and create an event in one step. We also removed the need for an additional step of marking an event as &quot;active&quot; before interacting with it. <br/> <br/> To visualize the new flow, we created wireframes on a whiteboard which helped us to validate the new process before implementing it. The new flow now allows users to simply:<br/><br/>1. Open the map screen<br/>2. Find the location you want to travel and go diving<br/>3. Click on the location and click &quot;Add Event&quot;-button on popup<br/>4. Fill the form with information and submit<br/>5. Event opens automatically after submitting or you can open it from the list<br/>6. Now you can do actions like dive, chat, change settings etc. with the event<br/><br/>This redesign not only simplifies the event creation process but also enhances the user experience by removing unnecessary steps and making it more intuitive and efficient.</h2><div class="swiper"><div class="swiper-wrapper"><div class="swiper-slide"><img src="/_next/static/media/concept_1.a8010702.png" width="1400" height="780" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" loading="lazy" style="color:transparent"/></div><div class="swiper-slide"><img src="/_next/static/media/concept_2.6e2e13b7.png" width="1400" height="620" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" loading="lazy" style="color:transparent"/></div></div><div class="swiper-button-prev"></div><div class="swiper-button-next"></div></div><h1 class="mt-20 text-1xl md:text-4xl text-white font-bold leading-tight text-left">Problem 2: Visualization</h1><h2 class="mt-5 text-1xl md:text-xl text-white leading-tight text-left my-20">In order to address the issue of a cluttered visual design and difficulty accessing information within the app, we leveraged previously collected feedback from our users to understand their specific pain points and needs. Based on this feedback, we implemented a clean and minimalistic visual design, using clear typography, ample white space, and intuitive icons to guide the user. Additionally, we reorganized the information architecture of the app to make it more logical and easy to navigate, using clear headings, grouping related information together and providing a search function. These changes were directly informed by the feedback we received, and allowed us to improve the usability and accessibility of the app, resulting in a better user experience.</h2><div class="items-center"><iframe width="960" height="540" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ytfsuFhI6-A" title="YouTube video player" frameBorder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div></section></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/projects/sukeltaja","query":{},"buildId":"gT7cEW8uYIQHuAsgloEAc","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
