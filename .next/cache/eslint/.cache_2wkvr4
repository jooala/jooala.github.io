organization, Botnia Vikings, to develop and\r\n                  enhance their visual identity. The client, Botnia\r\n                  Vikings, is a Esports organization based in Finland,\r\n                  focused on fostering a competitive and dynamic\r\n                  gaming community.\r\n                  <br /> <br />\r\n                  My role in this project was to create a cohesive\r\n                  visual language that effectively represents the\r\n                  team's values and objectives. The scope of work\r\n                  included designing various creative assets such as\r\n                  images and templates for social media, website\r\n                  concept art, and branding guidelines. These\r\n                  deliverables were instrumental in establishing a\r\n                  consistent visual identity for the team and its\r\n                  members, across various touchpoints. The images and\r\n                  templates for social media were crafted to be\r\n                  visually engaging, while also aligning with the\r\n                  team's brand guidelines, to effectively communicate\r\n                  the team's message and create a sense of unity among\r\n                  its followers.\r\n                  <br /> <br />\r\n                  The branding guidelines were developed to ensure\r\n                  that all future communications and designs produced\r\n                  by the team adhered to a consistent visual language,\r\n                  creating a cohesive and recognizable brand identity.\r\n                  Overall, the project was a great opportunity for me\r\n                  to showcase my design skills and contribute to the\r\n                  growth of a dynamic and competitive Esports\r\n                  organization. The deliverables produced were\r\n                  well-received by the client and helped to establish\r\n                  a strong and recognizable visual identity for the\r\n                  team.\r\n                </p>\r\n              </div>\r\n              <Image\r\n                src={kuva}\r\n                className=\"w-full h-full bg-center bg-cover col-span-1 flex-nowrap -mt-12 hidden xl:block\"\r\n              />\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className=\"image-main items-center grid grid-col-1 my-20 gap-4\">\r\n              <img src=\"/images/botnia/banner3.png\" />\r\n              <img\r\n                src=\"/images/botnia/colors.png\"\r\n                className=\"justify-self-center\t\"\r\n              />\r\n              <img\r\n                src=\"/images/botnia/fontfamily.png\"\r\n                className=\"justify-self-center\t\"\r\n              />\r\n              <img src=\"/images/botnia/victory2.png\" />\r\n              <img src=\"/images/botnia/Defeat_Screen2.png\" />\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className=\"grid grid-cols-3\">\r\n              <div className=\"grid-span-2\">\r\n                <img src=\"/images/botnia/eagles.jpg\" />\r\n              </div>\r\n              <div className=\"image-main items-center grid grid-span-2 mx-auto pb-10 flex \">\r\n                <img src=\"/images/botnia/botniabanner.jpg\" />\r\n                <img src=\"/images/botnia/twitter.jpg\" />\r\n                <img src=\"/images/botnia/youtube_leftside.jpg\" />\r\n                <img src=\"/images/botnia/discord.jpg\" />\r\n              </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </section>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n","E:\\Koulujuttui\\portfolio\\2022portfolio\\2022portfolio\\src\\pages\\projects\\bugbear.js",[],[],"E:\\Koulujuttui\\portfolio\\2022portfolio\\2022portfolio\\src\\pages\\projects\\reaktor.js",["93","94","95","96","97"],[],"import Header from '../Header';\r\n\r\nexport default function Reaktor() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <section className=\"min-h-screen\">\r\n        <Header />\r\n        <div id=\"main\">\r\n          <div className=\"container pt-24 md:pt-24 px-24 mx-auto flex flex-wrap flex-col md:flex-row items-center\">\r\n            <h1 className=\"my-20 text-3xl md:text-5xl text-white font-bold leading-tight text-left\">\r\n              <span className=\"bg-clip-text font-poppins\">\r\n                Reaktor 2022 UX Designer Assignment\r\n              </span>\r\n            </h1>\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            <div className=\"grid grid-cols-4 text-xl text-white leading-tight text-left\">\r\n              <div className=\"col-span-2 mr-10\">\r\n                <p>\r\n                  As a candidate for the Reaktor UX Designer role for\r\n                  Summer 2022, I was tasked with streamlining the user\r\n                  experience of a digital healthcare mobile\r\n                  application for an imaginary company.\r\n                  <br /> <br />\r\n                  The challenge was to choose two tasks from four\r\n                  different options, and create a user flow for chosen\r\n                  tasks.\r\n                  <br /> <br />\r\n                  The goal of Case C: Monitoring was to design a\r\n                  user-friendly interface that allows users to easily\r\n                  report their blood pressure to their doctor. The\r\n                  difficulty here was that user should be measuring\r\n                  their blood pressure twice and the average number\r\n                  then would be submitted for the doctor.\r\n                  <br /> <br />\r\n                  In Case D: Prescriptions, the goal was to create a\r\n                  user-friendly interface for checking the validity of\r\n                  a user's prescription and locating the nearest\r\n                  pharmacy that has the medication available.\r\n                  <br /> <br />\r\n                  I used Figma to create the user interface for this\r\n                  assignment, which allowed me to create high-fidelity\r\n                  wireframes and interactive prototypes that\r\n                  effectively convey the proposed design solutions.\r\n                  This helped me to validate my design choices and\r\n                  prototype my design with actual device on your\r\n                  hands.\r\n                  <br /> <br />\r\n                  This assignment was an excellent opportunity for me\r\n                  to showcase my skills as a UX designer and\r\n                  demonstrate my ability to improve the user\r\n                  experience of a digital healthcare mobile\r\n                  application.

The\r\n                  problem was that the task of measuring blood\r\n                  pressure was being assumed to be a known process for\r\n                  all patients, however, measuring blood pressure\r\n                  might not be a familiar process for everyone. This\r\n                  presented a challenge as it was important to ensure\r\n                  that the application was able to cater to the needs\r\n                  of all users, regardless of their level of\r\n                  familiarity with blood pressure measurement.\r\n                  <br /> <br />\r\n                  To address this issue, I proposed a solution that\r\n                  involved providing an opt-out option for\r\n                  instructions on the correct way to measure blood\r\n                  pressure. This would ensure that new users who may\r\n                  not have had the opportunity to receive guidance on\r\n                  blood pressure measurement, would still be able to\r\n                  use the application effectively. The instructions\r\n                  could be presented as their own app screen or as a\r\n                  pop-off notification when the user opens the blood\r\n                  pressure measurement feature.\r\n                  <br /> <br />\r\n                  This solution was especially relevant given the\r\n                  current Covid-19 pandemic, where remote appointments\r\n                  for health checks have become more common. The\r\n                  absence of face-to-face guidance from healthcare\r\n                  professionals has highlighted the importance of\r\n                  providing clear and easy-to-understand instructions\r\n                  within digital health applications to ensure that\r\n                  all users are able to use the application\r\n                  effectively.\r\n                </p>\r\n              </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className=\" grid grid-cols-4 text-xl text-white mt-10 leading-tight text-left\">\r\n              <h1 className=\"mt-10 col-span-4 text-1xl md:text-4xl text-white font-bold  leading-tight text-left\">\r\n                Case C: Problem 2 - Submitting the numbers\r\n              </h1>\r\n              <div className=\"col-span-2 mt-5 text-left\">\r\n                <p>\r\n                  As I continued to work on the Case C -assignment, I\r\n                  identified an additional issue that needed to be\r\n                  addressed. The problem was that the process of\r\n                  measuring blood pressure and submitting the results\r\n                  to the doctor was unnecessarily complex and\r\n                  confusing for the users. The issue was that the\r\n                  users were required to enter the same information\r\n                  multiple times, which led to confusion and a poor\r\n                  user experience.\r\n                  <br /> <br />\r\n                  To solve this issue, I proposed a solution that\r\n                  involved creating a seamless flow that guides the\r\n                  users through the process of measuring and\r\n                  submitting their blood pressure results. The\r\n                  solution involved using a 2-step input screen and a\r\n                  results screen that are divided by animations to\r\n                  clearly illustrate the user's progress. This would\r\n                  help users to understand the process and make it\r\n                  more intuitive.\r\n                  <br /> <br />\r\n                  The input format for blood pressure was chosen to be\r\n                  a \"calculator-like\" component that most smart device\r\n                  users are already accustomed to. This design\r\n                  decision was made to make it easy for users to\r\n                  understand and use the feature, and to minimize the\r\n                  chance of errors.\r\n                </p>\r\n              </div>\r\n              <img\r\n                src=\"/images/reaktor/bloodpressure2.png\"\r\n                className=\" col-span-2 ml-20 hidden xl:block\"\r\n              />\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n            <div className=\" grid grid-cols-4 text-xl text-white mt-10 leading-tight text-left\">\r\n              <h1 className=\"mt-10 col-span-4 text-1xl md:text-4xl text-white font-bold  leading-tight text-left\">\r\n                Case D: Problem 3 - Get your medications!\r\n              </h1>\r\n              <div className=\"col-span-4 mt-5 text-left\">\r\n                <p>\r\n                  As I delved deeper into the Case D -assignment,\r\n                  which involved designing a user-friendly interface\r\n                  for checking the validity of prescriptions and\r\n                  locating the nearest pharmacies that have the\r\n                  medication available, I encountered a challenging\r\n                  issue that required a thoughtful solution. The\r\n                  problem was that it was difficult for users to\r\n                  quickly and easily find the closest pharmacies that\r\n                  had the medication they needed in stock. This\r\n                  presented a problem as it could lead to users\r\n                  wasting time and resources searching for medication\r\n                  that may not be available.\r\n                  <br /> <br />\r\n                  For this case I ideated that using a \"Google\r\n                  Maps\"-like service to display the closest pharmacies\r\n                  on a map would be the best. The map would be\r\n                  color-coded, with green indicating pharmacies that\r\n                  have the medication in stock, and grey indicating\r\n                  those that do not. Additionally, the map would\r\n                  display additional information such as the opening\r\n                  hours of the different pharmacies. This would help\r\n                  users to quickly and easily identify the closest\r\n                  pharmacies that have the medication they need in\r\n                  stock, and also plan their visit accordingly.\r\n                  <br /> <br />\r\n                  In addition to this, I also incorporated the use of\r\n                  GPS data from the user's device to help locate the\r\n                  closest pharmacies, and an integration with the\r\n                  device's navigation application.

This course was part of\r\n                Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, which means\r\n                that we didn't have any prior experience with UX.\r\n                <br />\r\n                <br />\r\n                Our primary objective was to add new features from the\r\n                backlog and simplify the user experience of the app,\r\n                while still retaining the essential features that the\r\n                client requested. To accomplish this, we utilized\r\n                design tools Figma and Photoshop to design and\r\n                prototype the user experience, and we implemented the\r\n                frontend using React Native and Expo, and the backend\r\n                with Node and the Express library.\r\n                <br />\r\n                <br />\r\n                Throughout the project, we worked closely with the\r\n                client to ensure that their needs and preferences were\r\n                being met. I am pleased to report that the client was\r\n                very satisfied with the final result. From my personal\r\n                view this work was the spark for me to get interested\r\n                more with UX/UI design than software development.\r\n                <br />\r\n                <br />\r\n                However as this wasn't a supposed to be UX course and\r\n                the course was mostly about learning software\r\n                development in agile teams than designing, we still\r\n                managed to pinpoint problems and create solutions from\r\n                our team's perspective and with the help of the user\r\n                feedback.\r\n              </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <Image\r\n              src={mockUp}\r\n              className=\"w-10/12 h-full bg-center bg-cover col-span-1 flex-nowrap -mt-12 hidden xl:block\"\r\n              unoptimized\r\n            />\r\n          </div>\r\n          <Image\r\n            src={coverKuva}\r\n            className=\"w-full h-full bg-center bg-cover duration-500 mt-20 rounded-3xl\"\r\n            unoptimized\r\n          ></Image>\r\n          <h1 className=\"mt-20 text-1xl md:text-4xl text-white font-bold leading-tight text-left\">\r\n            Problem 1: Creating event\r\n          </h1>\r\n          <h2 className=\"mt-5 text-1xl md:text-xl text-white leading-tight text-left my-20\">\r\n            Based on feedback from clients, we identified an\r\n            opportunity to streamline the process of creating an event\r\n            within our app. The previous process required users to\r\n            navigate through multiple screens and complete multiple\r\n            steps, including marking an event as \"active\" before being\r\n            able to interact with it. <br /> <br />\r\n            To address this issue, we redesigned the event creation\r\n            flow by reducing the number of steps and screen\r\n            transitions required. We achieved this by integrating the\r\n            event creation form directly within the map screen,\r\n            allowing users to easily find the location and create an\r\n            event in one step. We also removed the need for an\r\n            additional step of marking an event as \"active\" before\r\n            interacting with it. <br /> <br /> To visualize the new\r\n            flow, we created wireframes on a whiteboard which helped\r\n            us to validate the new process before implementing it. The\r\n            new flow now allows users to simply:\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            1. Open the map screen\r\n            <br />\r\n            2. Find the location you want to travel and go diving\r\n            <br />\r\n            3. Click on the location and click \"Add Event\"-button on\r\n            popup\r\n            <br />\r\n            4. Fill the form with information and submit\r\n            <br />\r\n            5. Event opens automatically after submitting or you can\r\n            open it from the list\r\n            <br />\r\n            6. Now you can do actions like dive, chat, change settings\r\n            etc. with the event\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            This redesign not only simplifies the event creation\r\n            process but also enhances the user experience by removing\r\n            unnecessary steps and making it more intuitive and\r\n            efficient.\r\n          </h2>\r\n\r\n          <Swiper\r\n            // install Swiper modules\r\n            modules={[Navigation, Pagination, Scrollbar, A11y]}\r\n            spaceBetween={50}\r\n            slidesPerView={1}\r\n            navigation\r\n            onSwiper={(swiper) => console.log(swiper)}\r\n            onSlideChange={() => console.log('slide change')}\r\n          >\r\n            <SwiperSlide>\r\n              <Image src={figmaKuva1} unoptimized></Image>\r\n            </SwiperSlide>\r\n            <SwiperSlide>\r\n              <Image src={figmaKuva2} unoptimized></Image>\r\n            </SwiperSlide>\r\n          </Swiper>\r\n\r\n          <h1 className=\"mt-20 text-1xl md:text-4xl text-white font-bold leading-tight text-left\">\r\n            Problem 2: Visualization\r\n          </h1>\r\n          <h2 className=\"mt-5 text-1xl md:text-xl text-white leading-tight text-left my-20\">\r\n            In order to address the issue of a cluttered visual design\r\n            and difficulty accessing information within the app, we\r\n            leveraged previously collected feedback from our users to\r\n            understand their specific pain points and needs. Based on\r\n            this feedback, we implemented a clean and minimalistic\r\n            visual design, using clear typography, ample white space,\r\n            and intuitive icons to guide the user. Additionally, we\r\n            reorganized the information architecture of the app to\r\n            make it more logical and easy to navigate, using clear\r\n            headings, grouping related information together and\r\n            providing a search function.

The app is aimed to enable the grocery\r\n                  partners to collect and fulfill orders in a more\r\n                  efficient and effective way. The preparation and\r\n                  collection process of food and grocery items differs\r\n                  greatly, thus the need for new tools to support our\r\n                  grocery partners.\r\n                  <br /> <br />\r\n                  My approach for this task was to create a design\r\n                  that is intuitive and easy to use for the grocery\r\n                  partners. I had the freedom to create custom\r\n                  components and explore various visual styles, while\r\n                  keeping in mind the consistency with the rest of\r\n                  Wolt's applications.

This approach would allow for a clear and\r\n                  organized overview of the orders, and make it easy\r\n                  for the user to quickly access the information they\r\n                  need.\r\n                  <br /> <br />\r\n                  The \"New\" section is intended for orders that are\r\n                  incoming and require confirmation and time estimates\r\n                  before moving to the \"Packing\" screen, where the\r\n                  collecting and packing of the orders takes place.\r\n                  <br /> <br />\r\n                  The \"Packing\" section is for orders that are\r\n                  currently being collected and packed, giving the the\r\n                  end-user real-time information about the progress of\r\n                  the order.\r\n                  <br /> <br />\r\n                  The \"Ready\" section is for orders that have been\r\n                  collected, packed and marked as ready for the\r\n                  courier to pick up. Idea behind this to help the\r\n                  grocery store worker to easily identify and keep\r\n                  track of the orders that are ready for delivery to\r\n                  the client.\r\n                </p>\r\n              </div>\r\n              <img\r\n                src=\"/images/wolt/orders.png\"\r\n                className=\" col-span-2 h-10/12 object-cover ml-20 -mt-20 hidden xl:block\"\r\n              />\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className=\" grid grid-cols-4 text-xl text-white mt-10 leading-tight text-left\">\r\n              <h1 className=\"mt-10 col-span-4 text-1xl md:text-4xl text-white font-bold  leading-tight text-right\">\r\n                Problem 2: Amount of items\r\n              </h1>\r\n              <img\r\n                src=\"/images/wolt/collection.png\"\r\n                className=\" col-span-2 h-10/12 object-cover -mt-56 hidden xl:block\"\r\n              />\r\n              <div className=\"col-span-2 mt-5 text-right\">\r\n                <p>\r\n                  Visualizing the missing items from the order was to\r\n                  help fastening the collection processes. Manually\r\n                  adding items one by one also couldn't be the answer\r\n                  as this would be slowing the collection phase too\r\n                  much. For the work task of adding items as collected\r\n                  was to include a button that allows the user to mark\r\n                  items as collected in the app. This feature would\r\n                  first automatically mark all items in the full\r\n                  quantity that the client ordered.\r\n                  <br /> <br />\r\n                  In case an item is out of stock or there isn't\r\n                  enough of a certain item, the user would have the\r\n                  ability to reduce the amount of the items. This\r\n                  would help keeping the collection phase faster than\r\n                  adding items one by one with \"add\"-button and\r\n                  simplifies communication of missing items for\r\n                  grocery partner company and in later phase for the\r\n                  client that ordered the groceries. The app would\r\n                  show a little notification of the item's status,\r\n                  indicating if the item is out of stock fully or\r\n                  partly, helping the user to understand the\r\n                  situation. This same component could also be used\r\n                  for UI of the customers to visualize missing items.\r\n                </p>\r\n              </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n            <div className=\" grid grid-cols-4 text-xl text-white mt-10 leading-tight text-left\">\r\n              <h1 className=\"mt-10 col-span-4 text-1xl md:text-4xl text-white font-bold  leading-tight text-let\">\r\n                Problem 3: Power-users!\r\n              </h1>\r\n              <div className=\"col-span-2 mt-5 text-left\">\r\n                <p>\r\n                  My approach to improve efficiency for more\r\n                  experienced workers was to create a feature that\r\n                  enables power-users to easily access and manage\r\n                  multiple active orders at once. Specifically, I\r\n                  added a button located on the header of the\r\n                  collection order screen that, when clicked, opens a\r\n                  menu displaying all current active and ready orders.\r\n                  This allows power-users to quickly browse through\r\n                  the orders while multitasking and collecting items\r\n                  for multiple different orders at the same time,\r\n                  eliminating the need to navigate back and forth\r\n                  multiple screens.\r\n                  <br /> <br />\r\n                  This feature is designed to be intuitive and\r\n                  user-friendly, ensuring that power-users are able to\r\n                  take full advantage of the app's features and\r\n                  improve their workflow. It allows power-users to\r\n                  manage multiple orders more efficiently, saving them\r\n                  time and increasing their productivity.\r\n                  <br /> <br />\r\n
